# GifTastic

## Overview

In this assignment, we used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, we must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

#### Instructions:
Enter a term into the search box. As you enter terms into the search box, buttons will appear above with the term entered and gifs related to that term will appear below. If you are not sure of a term to search then feel free to select one of the already populated buttons on the page.

The theme is TV Shows to inspire you to enter a TV Show term, but feel free to search any term that interests you.
